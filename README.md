# fitboost

This will slowly evolve into a health/fitness website and application integrating a custom machine learning model and an LLM and several other services that interest me and seem viable to apply.

## Running the application

1. `cd` into the project root directory
2. `sh run.sh`

## Branch

This integration brach serves the purpose of testing out how the different components of
the application communicate and connect with each other.
